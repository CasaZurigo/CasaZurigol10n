// Cardboard Recycling Event Detail

You can also return old electronic devices to the point of sale without any hesitation. A pre-disposal fee is included in the purchase price of electronic and electrical devices. Retailers are therefore obliged to take back devices of the same type that they distribute, even if you don't buy a new one.";

// Bio Recycling Event Detail
"recycling_organic_event_detail_description" = "In addition to all garden waste, you can also dispose of biodegradable kitchen waste and leftovers. By providing organic waste in the appropriate container, you need fewer Zuri bags, which also eases the burden on your wallet. Organic waste is processed into biogas and compost products at the Biogas Zurich AG digestion plant. The biogas is fed into the Energie 360¬∞ AG gas network and is available as renewable energy for heating, cooking, or electricity production.

Properties that do not yet have an organic waste container will be equipped throughout the year 2023. Simply toss the organic waste into the organic waste container and close it again.";

This is because they are not visually recognizable during collection. The exception is bio-waste bags with lattice print.";
